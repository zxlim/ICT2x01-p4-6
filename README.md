## How to Run
TBD

## Development Workflow
### Creating a new Feature
#### 1. Open a new Issue on GitHub
Describe the feature that is being worked on. Assign it to the relevant person and label the Issue accordingly (Is this a bug, documentation or enhancement related?).

#### 2. Branch off from `dev` branch on GitHub
Create a new branch with an indicative name starting with `feature/` (E.g. `feature/workflow`)

#### 3. Work on your feature in your new branch
Commit all additons or changes to the newly created branch. **Only work within the scope of the described feature** (Do not make changes that are irrelevant to the feature).

#### 4. Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub
Once all the necessary commits are pushed, open a new PR and tag the GitHub Issue for this feature. If possible, mark the PR with a relevant Label. Assign 2 reviewers to the PR.

#### 5. Wait for 2 Reviewers for PR approval
The approvers are to check and verify the changes before approving the PR. Approvers have the right to reject the PR, on which feedback must be provided by adding comments to the PR to justify the rejection.

#### 6. Perform merge commit via GitHub
Once approval requirements have been met, use the `Merge Commit` feature on the respective PR page to merge the approved changes into the `dev` branch. Merging can be done by the final approver. **Only perform merging using the GitHub web interface!** Once merged, **do not delete** the feature branch.
